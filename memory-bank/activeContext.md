# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on initializing the Memory Bank for the Vue AI Chat project. This involves documenting the project's structure, architecture, and key components to establish a foundation for future development and maintenance.

## Recent Changes

- Created the Memory Bank directory structure
- Documented core project aspects including:
  - Project brief and requirements
  - Product context and user experience goals
  - System architecture and design patterns
  - Technical stack and dependencies
- Analyzed existing code structure to understand the application's implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Memory Bank Initialization**:
   - Create the progress.md file to track project status
   - Ensure all core files are complete and accurate

2. **Explore Implementation Details**:
   - Review individual components in-depth
   - Document specific feature implementations (text, image, audio)

3. **Identify Improvement Opportunities**:
   - Note any areas that could benefit from refactoring or enhancement
   - Identify any technical debt to be addressed

4. **Set Up Development Environment**:
   - Ensure proper configuration of environment variables
   - Verify that development tools and extensions are in place

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Documentation Strategy**:
   - Focus on creating comprehensive, clear documentation
   - Organize information in a logical, hierarchical structure
   - Ensure documentation is actionable and supports future development

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns in the codebase
   - Follow established naming conventions and patterns
   - Ensure component reusability and modularity

3. **API Integration**:
   - Consider security implications of client-side API key usage
   - Document error handling approaches for API calls
   - Address potential rate limiting issues

4. **State Management**:
   - Use Pinia stores effectively for managing application state
   - Ensure proper reactivity and state updates
   - Maintain clean separation between UI and business logic

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Vue 3 Composition API**:
   - Prefer the Composition API over Options API for new components
   - Use `<script setup>` syntax for cleaner component code
   - Leverage composables for reusable logic

2. **Pinia Store Structure**:
   - Organize stores by feature domain
   - Use actions for async operations and complex state changes
   - Use getters for derived state

3. **Component Design**:
   - Create focused, single-responsibility components
   - Use props and events for parent-child communication
   - Leverage slots for flexible component composition

4. **Code Style**:
   - Follow consistent formatting and naming conventions
   - Use descriptive variable and function names
   - Document complex logic with clear comments

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **Project Structure**:
   - The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
   - Services are used to encapsulate external API communication
   - Stores manage application state and business logic

2. **OpenAI Integration**:
   - The application uses the OpenAI JavaScript SDK for API communication
   - Different endpoints are used for text, image, and audio generation
   - Results are processed and stored in local storage

3. **UI Architecture**:
   - Vuetify provides the core UI components and styling
   - Custom components build on Vuetify foundations
   - Responsive design principles are applied throughout

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Local storage is used for persistence but has size limitations
   - API calls should be optimized to minimize rate limiting issues
   - Rendering performance should be monitored, especially for chat history
