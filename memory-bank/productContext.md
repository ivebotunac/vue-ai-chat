# Product Context

## Purpose
Vue AI Chat addresses the growing need for accessible and user-friendly interfaces to interact with advanced AI models. As AI technologies become more powerful and versatile, there's a demand for applications that can simplify their use for everyday users. This project serves as both a practical tool for AI-generated content and a demonstration of modern web development practices.

## Problems Solved

1. **Complexity Barrier**: Abstract away the technical complexities of the OpenAI API, making advanced AI capabilities accessible to non-technical users.

2. **Context Management**: Provide a structured way to maintain conversation context, allowing for more natural and coherent interactions with AI models.

3. **Unified Interface**: Combine multiple AI modalities (text, image, audio) in a single, cohesive application rather than requiring users to navigate different tools.

4. **Content Persistence**: Enable users to save, revisit, and build upon their AI-generated content through local storage integration.

5. **Flexible Customization**: Allow users to select specific models, parameters, and settings to fine-tune AI outputs to their needs.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Intuitive Navigation**: Users should immediately understand how to switch between different generation modes and access their saved content.

2. **Responsive Feedback**: Clear loading states, error messages, and success indicators should guide users through the generation process.

3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced options should be available but not overwhelming, with sensible defaults for new users.

4. **Consistent Interaction**: Similar patterns should be used across text, image, and audio generation to build user familiarity.

5. **Visual Clarity**: The interface should emphasize the content being generated while maintaining a clean, distraction-free environment.

## Key User Flows

1. **Text Conversation**:
   - User selects text mode
   - User enters a prompt in the input field
   - System shows loading state while processing
   - AI response appears in the conversation thread
   - Conversation history is maintained for context
   - User can start a new chat or continue the current one

2. **Image Generation**:
   - User selects image mode
   - User enters a descriptive prompt
   - User (optionally) selects model and size parameters
   - System shows loading state while generating
   - Generated image appears in the conversation
   - User can download the image or generate new ones

3. **Audio Creation**:
   - User selects audio mode
   - User enters text to be spoken
   - User (optionally) selects voice, format, and speed
   - System processes the audio generation
   - Audio player appears with the generated content
   - User can play, pause, and download the audio file
