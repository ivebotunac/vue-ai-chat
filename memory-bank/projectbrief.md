# Project Brief: Vue AI Chat

## Overview
Vue AI Chat is a modern web application built with Vue.js that integrates with OpenAI APIs to provide text, image, and audio generation capabilities. The application allows users to interact with OpenAI's models in a user-friendly interface with multiple generation modes.

## Core Requirementsâˆ«
1. **Text Chat**: 
   - Implement chat functionality with OpenAI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o)
   - Support conversation history and context
   - Allow users to select different models

2. **Image Generation**:
   - Integrate with DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 models
   - Support various image sizes
   - Enable image downloading and storage

3. **Audio Generation**:
   - Implement text-to-speech using OpenAI's TTS models
   - Support different voices and audio formats
   - Allow adjustment of speech speed

4. **User Experience**:
   - Clean, intuitive interface for all generation modes
   - Seamless navigation between text, image, and audio features
   - Proper loading states and error handling

5. **Data Management**:
   - Local storage of conversation history
   - Organized state management
   - Efficient API integration

## Project Goals

1. Create a highly usable interface for AI content generation
2. Implement best practices for Vue 3 and modern frontend development
3. Build a maintainable and extensible codebase
4. Provide a showcase of OpenAI API integration
5. Support multiple languages through i18n internationalization

## Success Criteria

- All three modes (text, image, audio) function correctly
- Users can easily navigate between different generation modes
- Conversations and generated content can be saved and retrieved
- The application performs well and provides appropriate feedback
- Code follows best practices and is well-structured
