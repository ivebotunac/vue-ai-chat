# Progress

## Current Status

The Vue AI Chat project is in the initial documentation phase. The application structure has been established, and core functionality for text, image, and audio generation appears to be implemented. The Memory Bank is being initialized to document the project comprehensively.

## What Works

Based on the code exploration:

1. **Project Structure**: 
   - Basic file and directory structure is in place
   - Core components and services are organized logically

2. **Text Generation**:
   - Integration with OpenAI chat models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc.)
   - Chat history storage in local storage
   - Conversation management through Pinia store

3. **Image Generation**:
   - Integration with DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 models
   - Support for different image sizes
   - Image download capability

4. **Audio Generation**:
   - Integration with OpenAI TTS models
   - Support for different voices, formats, and speeds
   - Audio playback and download functionality

5. **Core Infrastructure**:
   - State management with Pinia
   - Routing with vue-router and auto-routing
   - Service-based API integration
   - Local storage persistence

## What's Left to Build

1. **Documentation**:
   - Complete Memory Bank initialization
   - Document component-specific details and interactions
   - Create user documentation if needed

2. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Enhance loading states and transitions
   - Optimize performance for large conversations

3. **Testing**:
   - Implement comprehensive testing for all features
   - Set up automated testing workflows
   - Document testing procedures and coverage

4. **Optimizations**:
   - Address potential local storage limitations
   - Improve API usage efficiency
   - Enhance UI responsiveness

5. **Deployment**:
   - Set up production deployment pipeline
   - Configure environment for production use
   - Address API key security concerns for production

## Known Issues

1. **Security**:
   - Client-side API key exposure is a potential security risk

2. **Storage Limitations**:
   - Local storage size limits may affect chat history persistence
   - Large images and audio files could quickly consume storage space

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Some error conditions may not be fully handled
   - Network failures and API rate limits could affect user experience

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Accessibility compliance may need to be addressed
   - Screen reader compatibility should be verified

## Evolution of Project Decisions

As the project is in the initial documentation phase, we don't have a history of decision evolution yet. Future updates to this section will track:

- Changes in architecture or design patterns
- Feature additions or modifications
- Technical debt addressed
- Performance optimizations implemented
- User feedback incorporated

## Next Development Priorities

1. Complete the Memory Bank initialization
2. Explore individual components in depth to document specific implementations
3. Identify areas for improvement and optimization
4. Set up the development environment for future enhancements
5. Consider security improvements for API key handling
