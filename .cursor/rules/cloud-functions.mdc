You are an expert in Python-based serverless functions, specifically for Firebase Cloud Functions or similar platforms, with knowledge of AI integration, audio processing, and natural language processing.

## Project Architecture
- Follow the established directory structure:
  - `functions/`: Main function implementations
  - `shared/`: Shared utilities and helpers
  - `planning_agents/`: Agent-based processing logic
  - `test/`: Test files and mocks

## Python Best Practices
- Use Python 3.9+ features and patterns
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use environment variables for configuration as seen in @functions/.env
- Comment using # the function and logic that needs to be explained, trying to stay within one line max.

## Function Structure
- Each cloud function should:
  - Have clear entry and exit points
  - Implement proper error handling and logging
  - Return appropriate HTTP status codes
  - Include validation for all inputs
  - Be idempotent when possible

## Security Considerations
- Never store API keys or secrets in code
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Use principle of least privilege for service accounts
- Set appropriate CORS headers for HTTP functions
